                    <h3>Music Maker Computer Application (CSI 2300-Object Oriented Computing)</h3>
                    
                    
                    
                    <li>Built a music making program that enables people to create their own songs. </li>
                        
                    <li>Supported BPM setting, creating multiple instruments, and placing notes. </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Implemented a simple saving and loading system to store and manage song data.</li>

                    <li>
                        Utilized JavaFX to create a clear UI for placing notes and choosing instruments.</li>

                    The reason I made this project is because in my free time, I write my own music using FL Studio. However, since this program may be difficult for new users to learn on their own, I wanted to create a simple and easy to use program that would help people learn the basics of music creation and inspire them to make songs of their own.

                    This project was very enjoyable for me since it involved my hobby of composing music. While making this project, I learned how to create multiple scenes (an instrument view and a note view) while using JavaFX. I also learned how to play notes at different pitches using an audio system in Java. I was able to syncronise these instruments together into a song by using a variable for the song's BPM within a timer.
